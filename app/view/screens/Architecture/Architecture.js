          The heart of this project is built with the{' '}
          <LinkComponent to="https://www.meteor.com">Meteor framework</LinkComponent>. The only big difference is that
          I've created a 'lite' mode which builds the UI components very fast. Rebuild times for a Meteor app are
          usually 2-3 seconds, but running in lite mode a rebuild takes less than 100ms (and is often less than 20ms).
          For me, this is a crucial developer experience which allows me to remain in a flow state when I'm iterating
          the UI ðŸ§˜.
        </Typography>
        <Typography component="div">
          Lite mode is a script that can be run from the <InlineCode>app</InlineCode> directory with{' '}
          <InlineCode>npm run start:ui</InlineCode>. The only drawback of this approach is that the serverside code does
          not run, therfore you can't subscribe to collections or make method (API) calls. I now see this as a blessing
          in disguise as it's forced me to completely separate all of the Meteor-specific logic out of the UI
          components.
        </Typography>
        <Typography component="div">
          The ui code all lives in the <InlineCode>app/view</InlineCode> directory and the code that fetches data and
          responds to user actions lives in the <InlineCode>app/controller</InlineCode> directory. There are two
          controllers, one which is used in lite mode (it can't talk to the backend server) and one that is used in
          regular mode (it can talk to the backend server). These are called <InlineCode>devStore</InlineCode> and{' '}
          <InlineCode>fullStore</InlineCode> respectively; they can be found in{' '}
          <InlineCode>app/controller/store.js</InlineCode>.

          The <InlineCode>app/model/api</InlineCode> directory contains a directory for each collection in our database.
          These directories also include the publications and methods (API calls) for that collection.

          Each app route points to a screen, and each screen is wrapped in the{' '}
          <InlineCode>TitleBarAndNavDrawer.js</InlineCode> component. This, itself, is wrapped in an{' '}
          <InlineCode>AppRoute</InlineCode> component which is a thin wrapper on a react-router{' '}

        <Typography component="div">
          JSS is used for styling. Most of the styling is done within the component itself, the more generic stuff is
          located in <InlineCode>app/view/styles</InlineCode>. Further info on{' '}

        <Typography component="div">
          In general, I save a components state variables to the Redux store. This does fragment the code somewhat but I
          think the payoff is worth it because it means that if a component unmounts, the user does not loose their
          state. This is particularly important when a user is filling in a form and then gets distracted by a
          notification. When they return to the form, we don't want them to have to start from scratch.

          Some things don't fit neatly into the MVC categories (for logical or practical reasons). In these cases they
          have been put into other directories.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h3">Imports</Typography>
        <Typography>
          The <InlineCode>app/imports</InlineCode> directory contains code that is shared in many places and across the
          boundaries of MVC. Things such as routing and security.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h3">Serverless functions</Typography>
        <Typography>
          I'll write a whole page about this at some point, but for now I'll just mention that the{' '}
          <InlineCode>serverless</InlineCode> directory allows us to deploy serverless functions (using{' '}
          <LinkComponent to="https://www.zeit.co">Zeit Now</LinkComponent>). Really handy for off-loading long-running
          processes, so that your Meteor server does not become slow to client requests.
