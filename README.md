# Meteor Boilerplate

A fast and highly customisable Meteor.js boiler plate app.
The UI is handled by Material Design and the performance is achieved 
by selective tree-shaking and judicious use of dynamic imports, to
keep the client bundle as small as possible.

**>>> [View Demo](https://meteor.ninjapixel.io) <<<**


* Front end: [React](https://reactjs.org/) ✌️
* UI: [MUI](https://material-ui.com/) (Material Design) 🎨
* Bundle size: [<250kB gZipped](https://www.ninjapixel.io/meteor-bundle-size.html) 🐭
* Styling: [JSS](http://cssinjs.org/) 💅
* Security: Users, roles and groups 🔐
* Email: Just hook-up your favourite SMTP provider 📧
* Developer friendly: you can use the `start:ui` cmd to just load the UI, for a snappy developer experience with Hot Module Reloading. It generally takes bout 50ms for a change to be built and loaded in the browser, which is about 3s quicker than if you were using
  the Meteor bundler (i.e. with `npm start`) 🤓
* λ functions: Execute intensive functions in the cloud, making sure that your node server is always free to fulfil client requests 😅

## Start Guide

Note that the `meteor` app lives in the `/app` directory. The root directory contains
some general setup, such as linting, and leaves space for including other items such as end-to-end
tests, a react native app and serverless functions.

### Installing dependencies

Use `npm` to install the dependencies. Note that there are a few `package.json` files in the project.

```bash
npm i
cd serverless
npm i
cd ../app
meteor npm i
```

### Starting the app

To run the full-blown app - front-end, back-end and MongoDB database:

```bash
cd app
meteor npm i
npm start
```

If you just want to work on the UI, then you can run:
```bash
cd app
npm run start:ui
```

## λ functions

This projects uses Zeit Now to deploy and execute lambda functions.

Meteor runs a Node server; it is single threaded process and we want to make sure that
big computations don't grind the server to a halt. Hence the λ functions. Any big computations
should be sent to a λ function. The beauty of this is that we can spin up as many λ functions at
once and not need to even worry about scaling our app.

Dependencies for the serverless functions are defined in `serverless/package.json`. Make sure they are installed by running

        cd serverless
        npm install

### Deploying λ functions

Create an account with Zeit and [install the NOW desktop client or CLI](https://zeit.co/download). Then, from the `serverless` directory deploy
your lambda functions by running:

        now
